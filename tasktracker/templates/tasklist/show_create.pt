A task list is a container for tasks.  Task lists are used to organize
tasks by area, or by sub-project.  For example, there might be a task
list for tasks around the office, and another task list for organizing
opposition to a certain law.

<span tal:replace="structure python: h.form(h.url(action='create'), method='post')" />

<metal:do use-macro="here/_form/macros/form" />

<span tal:replace="structure python: h.end_form()" />
