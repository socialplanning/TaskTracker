The tasklist update form now works.  Previously it would reject all
submissions, because the ``authenticator`` form field used for XSRF
protection was missing from the form served to the user (and therefore
missing from the form submission) so tasktracker's secure_forms
rejected all submissions.  This  has been fixed: the ``authenticator``
was being stripped out of the response by ``formencode.htmlfill``
which did not recognize it as part of the schema.  Passing parameter
``force_defaults=False`` to ``formencode.htmlfill.render`` solves the
problem.
